# Cryptographic attack on discrete logarithm to factorise RSA Key

In this project, we have studied different aspects of discrete logarithm problem.
Implementation of Baby step Giant step, Pollard Rho , Polhig Hellman. Using GMP (GNU Multiple Precision) to manage number with lot of digits (more than 13 digits)
They commit us to be carefull in choosing parameters for the cryptosystem which security is based on discrete logarithm problem
